# verlet-doodles

A Verlet integration 2D physics engine written in zig... for fun.

This is a simple implementation of a verlet integration simulation written in zig. 
It is for for my own education and learning of the zig programming language and game physics.

## Sources of Inspiration

The source of inspiration for this project comes from the following video and associated videos and repository:

[Writing a Physics Engine From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS_qeBy3aQI)

## Dependencies

[Raylib Zig Bindings](https://github.com/raylib-zig/raylib-zig)

## Build and run

To build the project, make sure you have Zig installed on your system. Then, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
zig build run
```

## TODO

- [ ] Click to set emitter location
- [ ] Reset button
- [ ] Change colors over time
- [ ] Random size particles
- [ ] Smarter collision algorithm
- [ ] Change container shape
- [ ] Turn gravity on/off
